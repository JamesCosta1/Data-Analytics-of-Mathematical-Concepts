# Data-Analytics-of-Mathematical-Concepts
Conducted an in-depth analysis of Collatz sequences in Jupyter Notebook to determine the length and largest elements of sequences generated by various initial integers (seeds). This projectâ€™s goal is to inspire new ways of approaching the Collatz conjecture in hopes of generating new ideas or methods to solve the 90-year-old problem. Furthermore, this project demonstrates my ability to work independently and use software to analyze mathematical ideas.
